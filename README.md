## About The Project

This is a boilerplate for building a reusable component library in React. The boilerplate is built with create-react-app and includes several useful tools for developing, testing, and documenting your components.

The library uses Rollup as the bundler to create the final output bundle that can be published to npm or used in other projects. SCSS is used for styling the components.

For testing, the library includes Jest and React Testing Library, which allows you to write unit and integration tests for your components.

Finally, Storybook is included for developing and documenting your components. With Storybook, you can see your components in isolation and document their usage with examples and documentation.

Overall, this boilerplate provides a great starting point for building a reusable component library that is well-tested, well-documented, and easy to use in other projects.
